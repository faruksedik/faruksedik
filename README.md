## 🚀 Data Engineer | Python • SQL • AWS • ETL Pipelines

Results-driven Data Engineering professional with hands-on experience building **cloud-based data pipelines, ETL workflows, and scalable data systems**.

I specialize in transforming raw data into reliable, production-ready datasets using **Python, SQL, and AWS services**. My work focuses on designing efficient data workflows, optimizing database performance, and implementing structured data architectures.

### 🔧 Core Competencies
- ETL / ELT Pipeline Development  
- Workflow Orchestration (Apache Airflow)  
- AWS (S3, EC2, RDS, IAM)  
- Data Modeling & Warehousing  
- SQL Query Optimization & Indexing  
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform - foundational)

### 🏗 What I’m Currently Building
- Production-grade Airflow pipelines on AWS  
- Cloud-native data architectures  
- Backend-integrated data systems  
- Scalable and modular data processing frameworks  

With a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering and Agricultural & Environmental Engineering, I bring analytical depth, systems thinking, and structured problem-solving to data engineering challenges.

I am actively seeking opportunities to contribute to data-driven teams where I can design, build, and optimize reliable data infrastructure.

📫 Let’s connect and build scalable data solutions.
